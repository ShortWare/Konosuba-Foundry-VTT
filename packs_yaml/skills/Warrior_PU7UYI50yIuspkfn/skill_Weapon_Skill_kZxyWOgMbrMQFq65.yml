    Upon acquiring this skill, select one weapon type. Write this skill down
    with the chosen type, such as Weapon Skill: One-Handed Sword. Add 1d6 to any
    hit checks made with the chosen weapon. Treat instances of Weapon Skill for
    other weapons as separate skills. You cannot apply more than one Weapon
    Skill at a time.

    You have mastered the use of a specific weapon. Among adventurers, the skill
    is  named differently based on what weapon  it is, such as One-Handed Sword
    Skill or Bow Skill.
