    Add SL×5 to your maximum HP.

    A skill that simply raises your stamina. You’re eager to raise your physical
    toughness. Whenever you have free time, you can be found doing sit-ups,
    pull-ups, and push-ups. You personally embody the idea that one’s endurance
    is what ultimately determines a battle’s outcome.
