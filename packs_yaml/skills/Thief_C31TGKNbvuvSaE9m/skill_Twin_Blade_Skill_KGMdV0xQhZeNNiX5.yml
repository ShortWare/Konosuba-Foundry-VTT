    This skill comes into effect when equipping two weapons, one in the right
    hand and one in the left, that meet the usage conditions. Add the two
    equipped weapons’ Hit Modifiers, attack powers, and action modifiers
    together, treating them as a single weapon with those stats, both weapon
    categories, and as a Dual–Equip Slot type. You may use any effects of either
    weapon, but you may only activate one that needs declaring at any given
    time.
