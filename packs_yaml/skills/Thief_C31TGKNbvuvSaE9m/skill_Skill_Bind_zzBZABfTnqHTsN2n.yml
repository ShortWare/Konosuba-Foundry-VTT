  effects: >-
    Use when a target declares any skill other than one with Timing: Passive.
    Negate that skill’s effects and end it, even if it has a duration. The skill
    is still used, even if the effects don’t resolve, so the target still spends
    any cost for that skill that they normally would.

    The skill to use fright or surprise to stop an opponent’s actions.
